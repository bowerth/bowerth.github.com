Please find enclosed my CV in application for the Assistant Research Scientist post advertised on the homepage of the Indiana University Network Science Institute.

The nature of my work experience has prepared me for this position. It involved a great deal of independent research in the area of network visualization, requiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. For one project, the Trade in Value-added initiative, the understanding of global trade linkages required modern visualization techniques. I found this subject very stimulating.

Contancts established at the R user conference in 2014 in Los Angeles and the PyData Paris 2015 brought me in touch with machine learning subjects and ongoing co-operation with MarkLogic provides a platform for working with voluminous, unstructured data.

I am able to structure software development projects involving graphical user interfaces, with a keen eye for detail and I should be very grateful for the opportunity to progress to academic standards. I am able to take on the responsibility of this position immediately, and have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
