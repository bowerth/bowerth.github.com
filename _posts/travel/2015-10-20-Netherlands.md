## Amsterdam

### Eat

Jackson Dubois, Spui 10-A http://www.jacksondubois.com

### Drink

CutThroat, next to Boeurs van Berlage (wifi: testpass)

### Getting around

The bicycle is ideal for exploring the surrounding countryside. Within half an hour you're out of town. Go North, take the ferry across the ''IJ'' to ''Waterland''. Or go South, into the ''Amsterdamse Bos'' (a giant park), or follow the river ''Amstel'' where Rembrandt worked.
You can also take your bike on the metro (with a reduced fare ticket, see [public transport webpage](http://www.gvb.nl/english/travellers/tickets-and-fares/Pages/Dog.aspx)) to the end of the line at ''Gaasperplas'', and cycle along rivers and windmills to old fortified towns like Weesp , Muiden and Naarden.
