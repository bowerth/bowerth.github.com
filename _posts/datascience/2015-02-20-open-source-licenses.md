## Licenses

### EUPL

EUPL license is simple and meaningful and has been created for the EC public institutions

http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc5b9a.pdf?id=32429

- internal rules about OSS development and collaboration
- clarifying the position of developed software
- there is not a set of guidelines that can be followed
- even if there is a work in progress about that
- intention to constitute a OSS expert group

### BSD 3

You can do whatever you want with BSD-licensed code as long as you give the original author credit. Specifically:

  - don't remove their name from the code and don't claim that you wrote it
  - let others know you're using code you didn't write
  - don't use the author's name in advertising your product

Other than that, do whatever you like as long as you don't sue them. You don't have to:

  - Provide their code
  - License your code as open source
  - Provide your changes to their code
