### Analyst/Statistician - Well-being and Labour Market Statistics(Job Number: 09902)

#### Description
 
The OECD’s mission – Better Policies for Better Lives – promotes policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. It provides a unique forum in which governments work together to share experiences on what drives economic, social and environmental change, seeking solutions to common problems.  
 
Statistics play a key role in the OECD’s work and in informing a wide range of external stakeholders. The OECD Statistics Directorate (STD) provides statistics on a comparable basis to analysts and policy makers inside and outside the OECD. STD also develops international statistical standards, advances statistical methodology and co-ordinates statistical activities within the Organisation and with other international agencies. A key role for the STD in over the next few years is to contribute to the OECD Development Centre’s Multi-dimensional Country Reviews (MDCRs). The MDCRs were introduced by the Development Centre and contribute to the OECD strategy on Development, adopted at the 2012 OECD Meeting of the Council at Ministerial level. They are intended to be one of the most important analytical and policy tools in the OECD’s co-operation with developing countries. The Reviews - designed specifically for developing economies - bring together the combined expertise of the OECD Development Centre, the Economics Department and the Statistics Directorate.

We are looking for an experienced Analyst/Statistician with an excellent knowledge of the measurement of well-being and sound analytical skills to contribute to STD work on MDCRs in conjunction with staff from the OECD Development Centre and the Economics Department. The role would also involve contributing to STD work on the measurement of job quality, and further research on issues relating to the measurement of well-being. S/He will also contribute to the Directorate’s on-going work on labour market statistics. The selected person should have demonstrated experience in applying measurement frameworks to assess outcomes in a developing country context, a good understanding of the conceptual and measurement issues that are central to measuring well-being, and a sound understanding of how labour market outcomes fit within a well-being framework.
