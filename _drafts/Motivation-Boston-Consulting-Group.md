**Lead Knowledge Analyst, Statistical Analytics**

Dear Mrs. Schustek, 

I am contacting you about the job posting 79761 on careers.stackoverflow.com. If you consider some of my skills or experience relevant for the job and would like to ask additional questions by phone, an early reply will oblige.

Master's degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science
:   As part of my university degree in International Economics, I chose to pursue specialisation in continuous time finance where advanced methods from statistics, mathematics and computer science are applied. The arbitrage-free price of complex derivatives can be calculated from stochastic differential equations. Those have either mathematical closed-form solutions or numerical solutions requiring programming approaches in Matlab or comparable environments.

Background in statistical analysis and modeling, data mining, and predictive analytics
:   In my job as statistician at a major policy think tank, I am exposed to a very dynamic and pioneering environment. In my situation between senior policy analysts and IT experts, I need to identify possible approaches and break down the complexity of results to key messages. I manage to stay up-to-date with latest developments and concepts of data science through online courses offered by open learning platforms such as Coursera and edX. This includes assignments outside my comfort zone, understanding of large data treatment concepts and setting up cloud computing instances. I apply this knowledge in projects with colleagues, partners from industry (Microsoft Azure for machine learning) and academia. In addition to my job, I instructed a course on applied statistics at a renowned Grand École for statistics and economics in Paris (ENSAE), work jointly with neuroscience researchers at the École Normale Supérieure on machine learning topics and share experiences with Elsevier and US American researchers on text mining and development of Scientometric/Bibliometric indicators.

Several years of practical work experience
:   I started working in the Statistics Directorate in May 2010 before I changed to the Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation in October where I have been responsible for the OECD Structural Analysis Database. Since 2012, I continue developing tools for National Accounts by detailed economic activity statistics and provide major contributions to the project on [Trade in Value-Added](http://www.oecd.org/trade/valueadded). This project has high policy relevance and requires expert knowledge in the area of National Accounts and customs data combined with the mathematics of linear algebra and sophisticated balancing and checking systems.

Familiar with data modeling and data management / SQL
:   During my internship in the OECD Statistics Directorate, I familiarized myself with the Microsoft T-SQL query language. I used Microsoft SQL Server for the creation of a database that harmonizes the United States National Occupation Classification (NOC) with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Work on the Structural Analysis database requires a deep understanding of International Standard Industry Classifcations as well as detailed knowledge of OECD member countries' national industry classifications. In terms of data modeling, I develop functions for data estimation, such as back/forecasting with growth rates, application of distributions from non-official data sources as well as benchmarking to preserve addition, non-negativity and other criteria. 

Experienced in the use of SPSS, SAS or R, and data visualization software
:   In 2010 I started working on the OECD Structural Analysis database using existing SAS routines. This allowed me to pick up a new syntax and deliver results immediately. Soon after, I confronted the need for more flexible graphics systems that are capable to produce print-quality plots for publications. For our projects, we exploit linear algebra techniques and discovered R as the ideal software. Valuable community developments include functions to develop browser-embedded JavaScript user interfaces that allow analysts to benefit from R functionality without the need to set up their own enviroment. A public example (the first OECD cloud application) can be accessed at [oecd-icio.cloudapp.net](http://oecd-icio.cloudapp.net:3838). Please also see related presentation slides for internal trainings on [R shiny](http://bowerth.github.io/as_seminar_shiny) and [R graphics](http://bowerth.github.io/as_seminar_report).

Fluent in programming languages such as Java, C#, Python
:   My R package developments entail C and C++ modules when loops are required and Java modules if cross-platform solutions are required, e.g. libraries for application programming interfaces (APIs) that can later be re-used in other software tools. I exploit Python for text mining and machine learning due to performance advantages while keeping the prototyping benefits of an interpreted language.

Outstanding analytical skills, statistics expertise, and strong communication skills
:   I am performing data analysis based on solid statistical methods and communicat results to expert and non-expert audiences from 34 countries on a daily basis. I am frequently in touch with the Publication and Communication center in Berlin as well as national statistics institutions from our member countries. For internal communication and documentation of my work, I maintain a static webpage that allows the flexible and reproducible integration of results featuring automatic reports and interactive JavaScript contents.

Kind regards,
