## SAP Cloud 

- [SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://cal.sap.com/)

### SAP HANA Vora

- [HANA Vora Hadoop](http://go.sap.com/product/data-mgmt/hana-vora-hadoop.resources.html) leverages and extends the Apache Spark execution framework to provide enriched interactive analytics on enterprise and Hadoop data
- the [HANA Vora Developer Edition](https://go.sap.com/cmp/syb/crm-xu15-int-voratrdm/typ.html) cluster is running on top of Hortonworks HDP and Apache Spark
- [github: SAP: HANAVora-Extensions](https://github.com/SAP/HANAVora-Extensions) Spark extensions for business contexts. SAP has recently contributed a few new features to the Apache Spark ecosystem, available as a GitHub project, including a data hierarchy capability that enables drill-down analysis on Hadoop data, and an extension to Spark's data source API that improves distributed query efficiency from Spark to SAP HANA.

### SAP Spark

- [Integration betweeen SAP HANA and Apache Spark](http://startupfocus.saphana.com/spark/spark-sap-hana-integration/)

With over 200,000 customers and among the largest portfolios of enterprise applications, SAP’s software serves as the gateway to one of the most valuable treasure troves of enterprise data globally, and SAP HANA is the cornerstone of SAP’s platform strategy underpinning these enterprise applications moving forward. Now, the community of Spark developers and users will have full access as well, enabling a richness of analytical possibilities that has been hard to achieve otherwise.

- Spark can push down more advanced queries (e.g., complex joins, aggregates, and classification algorithms) – leveraging HANA’s horsepower and reducing expensive shuffles of data
- TGFs (Table Generating Functions) and Custom UDFs (User Defined functions) provide access to the full breadth of Spark’s capabilities through the Smart Data Access functionality
