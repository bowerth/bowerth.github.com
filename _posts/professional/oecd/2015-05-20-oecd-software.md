Microsoft SQL Server: 5 months full-time, complex joins as preparation for data analysis, shift-share transformation across classifications, pivoting, in-database regressions

SAS: combination of variational time series data for analysis, application of estimation methods (extension with growth rates, apply shares from secondary sources to enhance detail, adjust with top hierarchy member to pass sumcheck), dealing with 32 variables and countries, over 100 industries and more than 40 years as well as acquisition and harmonization of data source from official providers - some of the variables in deflated format require conversion to a format to establish additivity

R: linear algebra, graphics, reporting, web application development, function and data packaging, optimization with IBM CPLEX, custom functions for faster database operations exploiting Microsoft SQL bulk copy procedure
Python: Machine Learning with Scikit learn
