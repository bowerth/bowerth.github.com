## Announcing the Guardian Digital Fellowship

For the last two years the Guardian's Digital Development department has recruited a cohort of developers each year to join us. They have been drawn from backgrounds that we would not normally recruit from. For 2016 the programme is getting a revamp and we're excited to share the details.

What is the Guardian Digital Fellowship programme? In 2014 and 2015 we ran special recruitment schemes to hire people who would not normally match our hiring requirements and experience expectations. In our general hiring we aim to recruit people with more than two years of commercial development experience and who are engaged with the technical community.

In previous years we ran a graduate scheme that aimed to hire people with a higher education background. In 2016 we want to respond to what we've learnt and broaden who we think might be a good match for the programme.

Of course, we still want recent graduates to apply, but what we've learnt is that a love of programming and a desire to learn new technology is the most important thing that links the brilliant people we have already hired, not their background or education.

Currently the Fellowship is not a quick-start programme or training scheme. In future, as we learn more, it may evolve to include elements of that but for the moment it is really about people who already know how to code but cannot find an easy way into development or digital media.

Our 2016 programme is now open, applications close at the end of January 2016. Successful applicants will be invited to an assessment day early in March 2016. You can follow the Guardian Developers Twitter account for updates on what is happening and reminders of the deadline.

Our existing Digital Fellows have already made an impact on the Guardian and have moved quickly from learning to contributing and now they are starting to lead and mentor those who have followed in their footsteps.

Each year when we settle down to go through the many applications we receive it is exciting to see the wide range of people who have applied. While reading and discussions all the candidates is often hard work, knowing that you are meeting your future colleagues and friends is always a great feeling.

So, if you love technology and programming and you feel the Guardian stands for something that matters, then please do apply and take the opportunity to become one of our next generation of Fellows.

Full credit for the new name must go to my colleague Jenny Sivapalan who based it on the career plan of doctors rather than the slightly more famous alliance formed in Rivendell.
