## Formulae

### Mean squared error (MSE)

\\[
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_{i} - \hat{f} \left( x_{i}  \right) \right)^{2}
\\]

- $$\hat{f} \left( x_{i} \right)$$ is the prediction that $$\hat{f}$$ gives for the *i*th observation

The MSE will be small if the predicted responses are very close to the true
responses, and will be large if for some of the observations, the predicted and
true responses differ substantially.
