### Employee Guidelines

#### Why develop your case for teleworking?

- to set out clearly the grounds for your decision
- to optimize your chances of success
- to better understand the key uncertainties in the decision
- to enhance commitment and buy-in on the part of key stakeholders.

Be very clear about the kind of work you can do most effectively by teleworking and how every aspect of your job will be affected (including the impact on clients or colleagues). It is important to demonstrate how your teleworking arrangement will help to enhance the quality of your work and be beneficial to your department. Explain to your manager the grounds for your request, in three phases:

##### Phase 1: Analyze your job

- Review your job description as well the objectives set by your manager.
- Identify the main tasks and outcomes as well the time schedule.
- Identify those who will be affected by your telework arrangement (clients, colleagues...)
- Based on the previous analysis, identify the types of work and/or task that lend themselves to teleworking and those that must be carried out entirely in the office.

##### Phase 2: Measure Productivity

One of the hardest benefits to measure is productivity. The following tools are designed to help you and your manager to achieve more and improve performance through teleworking, as well as to demonstrate those improvements.

The first step is to identify the best performance measurements, and then set goals for each of the measurements you have identified.

- Think about the specific circumstances of your new work environment and how it enables you to be more effective.
- Brainstorm for the top ten ways to measure your success, including increased productivity, client service or quality, cost savings (if appropriate) and other performance criteria.
- With the help of your manager, list measurable performance standards within each area.
- Select measurements that can be easily tracked. If no measure of output is possible, you had better drop the telework option.

To provide a balanced picture, include at least one measurement that may be "at risk" of a drop in performance due to teleworking, at least in the transitional phase. See if the risk is real, or if you can actually improve performance in that measurement while teleworking.

##### Phase 3: Gain acceptance and move forward

- Present your case to your manager/director
- Address any concerns with your manager and colleagues.

Remember that teleworking can only be implemented on a voluntary basis and it is up to managers and directors to take the final decision.

##### Details of agreement

Two elements are critical to the success of teleworking arrangements:
- the details of the arrangements should be agreed to and clearly understood by both the teleworker and the manager
- the Staff Regulations, rules and instructions apply to all staff, whether teleworking or not.

We strongly advise drawing up a written document to serve as a reference point for future use in the event of any uncertainty as to what was originally agreed. The Organisation requires that an agreement be signed, setting out all the administrative and legal obligations on both parties. The following are the basic details to be discussed and agreed upon:

##### Checklist

- Voluntary nature of the arrangement
- Duration of the arrangement
- Issues of liability (personal and equipment)
- Responsibility for costs associated with telework (utilities and insurance)
- Health and safety responsibilities
- Any supplies, equipment and electronic networks remain the property of the employer.
- Obligation to comply with departmental policy on use of electronic networks.
