### Assistant Research Scientist, IUNI

http://iuni.iu.edu/about/posts.html#assist

IUNI (iuni.iu.edu) is looking to fill several Assistant Research Scientist positions appointed within the 3-tiered system of research ranks. Indiana University adopted the system of research ranks to create a defined career ladder structure and reward system for non-faculty researchers who hold the doctorate. Assistant Research Scientists at IUNI are expected to participate in collaborative projects, working alongside other IUNI faculty and staff. They are expected to contribute to the research goals and objectives of IUNI, provide scientific and intellectual input to formulating research aims and approaches, and to conduct research projects. They are encouraged to independently seek external funding for their research as well as to contribute to larger grants and proposals that involve other IUNI scientists. IUNI provides advanced computing resources, administrative support, as well as a thriving intellectual environment at the cutting-edge of data and network science. The job posting follows.

Indiana University is making a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment to create and expand the infrastructure for research and training in network science through the establishment of the Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI).

IUNI seeks applicants for several Assistant Research Scientist positions. These positions will be appointed for a two-year term with the possibility of renewal based on exemplary performance and continued funding. Qualified candidates will have completed a PhD in computer science, information science, economics, natural, or social sciences and have a strong background and experience in network science and data science. To employ theoretical, empirical, and mixed methods, the researchers will need both analytical/modeling skills and the technical capabilities to deal with big data.

Scientific areas of particular interest include (1) computational social science, where massive data from social media is analyzed to answer fundamental questions about individuals and society, with applications spanning from health to political science; (2) egocentric network analysis with expertise in multilevel modeling and dynamic networks; and (3) science of science, where large scholarly databases are built, analyzed, and modeled to explore topics such as the emergence of scientific fields, the diffusion of knowledge and expertise, the adoption of innovations, or the prediction of scholarly and societal impact; (4) data science, where the activities focus on carrying out the big data network analysis goals of the Institute, especially in the Health and Health Care research hub; (5) neuroscience, where research focuses on brain connectivity (connectomics) and its implications for cognitive, social and health functioning; (6)systems biology, where systems biology bridges network science approaches and human health.

Interested candidates should review the requirements at: http://indiana.peopleadmin.com/postings/1490 and submit their application including a cover letter that describes a network science research agenda and how applicants might engage in collaborative research projects with IUNI faculty, CV, and the name, email address and institutional affiliation/position of three references. Applications received by May 1 will be given full consideration, but applications will be accepted until all positions are filled.
