### Introduction

The Economist was founded in 1843 “to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress”. The use of data is central to everything we do as a newspaper and as a company. As we expand our data team, we are looking for a data expert who shares our values and can bring extraordinary skills and creativity to carry our mission into the 21st century.
