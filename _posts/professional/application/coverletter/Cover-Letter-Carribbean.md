*Type your Cover Letter below*

Dear Sir or Madame,

I have been working as statistician at the OECD  for the last 5.5 years under supervision of a mathematician from the UK.

I just turned 30 and seek employment outside Europe due to recent events. 

Over the course of the last 12 months, I have made considerable efforts to catch up with latest technologies, the collection at bowerth.github.io/categories.html#technical-ref gives an example.

I am mainly using R for my work, in order to communicate results and to facilitate access to developed routines, I have invested heavily in the R Shiny web framework hosted on Linux servers.
One example that I put together for a recent job application in the UK can be found at http://bowerth.github.io/datascience/2015/10/16/R-Libor-Tyc/

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,
Bo Werth

*Do you have knowledge of any of the main programming and scripting languages?*

I have very good knowledge of the R ecosystem and teach my colleagues in analytic and statistical seminars at the OECD.
I can create packages with inline documentation, perform continuous integration checks on them and use other programming languages with R where suitable (e.g. Java, C++).
I am confident to create small routines in Python. I am currently learning to use Scala to benefit from its static typing system.

*Do you have sound understanding of database concepts and web technologies?*

I have been using Microsoft SQL for the last 5+ years,  Sqlite for portable solutions and MarkLogic since mid-2015 in combination with XML data.
JavaScript, HTML, CSS are familiar from R and htmlwidgets (e.g. rCharts), please see my github profile at https://github.com/bowerth/

*Are you currently pursuing a degree in Information Technologies?*

I am enrolled in an IT bachelor degree in Munich since fall 2014 and have been studying distance courses. Since 2012, I have been regular user of the Coursera learning platform.
