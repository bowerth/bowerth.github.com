## Concepts

### Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)

- [aws: EMR: Getting Started](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/getting-started/)


#### [EMR Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs.html)

##### [Plan an Amazon EMR Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan.html)

This section explains configuration options for launching Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) clusters. Before you launch a cluster, review this information and make choices about the cluster options based on your data processing needs. The options that you choose depend on factors such as the following:

- the type of source data that you want to process
- the amount of source data and how you want to store it
- the acceptable duration and frequency of processing source data
- the network configuration and access control requirements for cluster connectivity
- the metrics for monitoring cluster activities, performance, and health
- the software that you choose to install in your cluster to process and analyze data
- the cost to run clusters based on the options that you choose
