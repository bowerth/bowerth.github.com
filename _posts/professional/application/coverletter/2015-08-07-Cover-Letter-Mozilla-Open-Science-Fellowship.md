### Cover Letter

Dear Sir or Madamme,

I am highly interested in making data from web services available to users.

You can find related information at http://bowerth.github.io/datascience/2015/04/07/Data-API/
This UI retrieves information from SDMX data sources: https://rjsdmx.shinyapps.io/sdmxBrowser
I am currently developing functions to connect to national providers https://github.com/bowerth/nsoApi

With OECD, I have a good response rate from national providers concerning the integration of additional data sources as well as other developers who create R packages and Java libraries for information retrieval from existing providers, e.g. https://github.com/amattioc/SDMX and https://github.com/ropengov/pxweb.

You can find my resume at http://bowerth.github.io/professional/2015/05/18/Curriculum/

Yours sincerely,
Bo Werth
