## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Windows

`R_LIBS`
:   `D:\R\R-3.2.1\library`

`R_LIBS_USER`
:   `D:\R\R-3.2.1\library`

`PATH` to select default R version of 
:   `D:\R\R-3.1.1\bin\x64`

## Packages

### Testing

#### Unit tests

Each new feature should be accompanied with unit tests, by using the testthat R package.
For each R-script file named script.R, a correspond test file should be created in tests/testthat directory, using the writing convention `test_<script>.R`
The `test_<script>.R` should have the following structure:

```r
require(rsdmx, quietly = TRUE) #load the rsdmx package
require(testthat) # load the testthat package
context("script") # create a unit test context for the given script file

#unit test 1
test_that("Test1",{
   ...
})

#unit test 2
test_that("Test2",{
   ...
})
```

#### Build tests

After any modification of the source code (bug fix, enhancement, added feature), a package build should be tested by the developer using the command R CMD check (requires installation of an R instance and RTools). The option --as-cran should be enabled to ensure the updated package will be later accepted by CRAN. Such program will run a set of check operations required for a proper package build, including the unit tests.
In order to guarantee a proper R package build, the R CMD check will be performed automatically after each commit, through Travis Continuous Integration (see [travis-ci.org]{https://travis-ci.org/opensdmx/rsdmx}). This second build test is required to ensure users will be able to successfully install the package from Github.
