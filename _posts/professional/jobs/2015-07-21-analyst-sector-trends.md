## Who are we?

MBIE is looking for analysts to join the Sector Trends team to help drive evidence-based policy with modern data analytics and statistical methods.  We work with policy teams on topics like regional development, tourism, science and innovation to help them understand what’s going on in New Zealand’s economy and turn it into practical policy recommendations.   If you’re excited by  understanding and analysing new data, then this job is for you.

## What do we do?

We have over a thousand economic data collections we regularly warehouse, and hundreds more we grab from all sources, tidy, and reshape for turning into cutting edge graphics and using in statistical models.  We’re involved in everything from identifying New Zealand’s information gaps in the policy areas we cover; through to sourcing, analysing, and presenting data and analysis to a wide range of users.

You’ll be part of a team of 12 using open source tools like R, JavaScript, LaTeX and Git in a fast paced environment. 

Your work might be the crucial piece of the jigsaw for some strategic thinking; it might appear as an interactive tool on our website, or it might go straight to a Minister’s desk.   

Who are we looking for?/Have you got what it takes?

If you’ve written thousands of lines of R code and know what dplyr, ggplot2 and Shiny are you’ve got a great head start; if not, you need a good basis in some other statistical coding environment like SAS and the willingness to jump in the deep end. 

People skills are crucial too – you’ll need to be a team player, able to communicate with non-specialists, and have a strong customer focus.

You might be a recent graduate, or an experienced analyst who wants to join a team that turns the dial up to 11.  Either way, you’ll be learning new techniques and tricks every day in our constantly-innovating atmosphere. 

Qualifications in statistics, econometrics, economics, or statistical computing would be a great advantage; but mostly we’re looking for people with the right attitude and the burning desire to see what’s happening behind the numbers.
