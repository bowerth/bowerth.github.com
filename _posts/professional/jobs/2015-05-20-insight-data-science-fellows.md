### Insight Data Science Fellows

#### Describe your research to a non-expert

- Interactive Analysis of Economic Data by Industry: adopt radiant framework for business data and decisions; extend with d3.js JavaScript visualization templates
- Batch Estimations and Data Screening Reports: design a set of high-level R functions to transform legacy SAS system; vectorized creation of estimation programs for batch routines; set up reporting procedure for checks on both input and output data
- Optimization Algorithms for Data Estimation: exploit IBM CPLEX libraries for quadratic constraint optimization of sparse matrices

#### What programming / scripting / statistical languages, data analysis software and/or databases have you worked with and in what capacity? Please make a detailed list. For each language, database or software, list how much time you spent working with it and briefly describe the work you did and what results you obtained to give us a sense of your proficiency.

- Microsoft SQL Server: 5 months full-time, complex joins as preparation for data analysis, shift-share transformation across classifications, pivoting, in-database regressions
- SAS: combination of variational time series data for analysis, application of estimation methods (extension with growth rates, apply shares from secondary sources to enhance detail, adjust with top hierarchy member to pass sumcheck), dealing with 32 variables and countries, over 100 industries and more than 40 years as well as acquisition and harmonization of data source from official providers - some of the variables in deflated format require conversion to a format to establish additivity
- R: linear algebra, graphics, reporting, web application development, function and data packaging, optimization with IBM CPLEX, custom functions for faster database operations exploiting Microsoft SQL bulk copy procedure
Python: Machine Learning with Scikit learn
