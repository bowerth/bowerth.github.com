	Setting up and Launch  
	From Highway 1 turn left at the shops and follow the road to the beach. A road runs along the beach front and there are several car parks off to the side. This is a wide sandy beach at low tide but some sections are narrow (about 15m wide) at high tide. The best place to launch is the southwest end of the beach at the estuary.  Almost guaranteed to meet other kiters if it is on.  
	On the Water  
	In a NW this is one of the first beaches that does not get badly affected by Kapiti Island. Picks up more swell than Paraparaumu and is onshore / cross-onshore for N, NW and W winds. The surf is normally messy but is a good place to start kiting in waves.

:   N, SW: Eastbourne  
	[Details](https://sites.google.com/site/wellingtonkitesurf/home/eastbourne)  
	Setting up and Launch  
	A better launch has been found with a wider beach! Stay on the main road to Eastbourne the turn right onto Miro St. Take the next left then the next right into Heketara St which leads to the beach.The best place to launch in Eastbourne is in front of the Rugby Club. Just stick to the roads closest to the sea front and you'll get there.  The beach is mainly shingle and the wind blows sideshore in Northerlies and Southerlies Ther's reasonable room on this beach but beware of powercables. This is the only sailable sideshore spot in Wellington and as such suits the low intermediate who can ride but is struggling to go upwind.  
	On the Water  
	The beach shelves fairly steeply into the water so you will be out of your depth when just a few meters offshore. The Northerly winds can be a bit daunting at first as you're looking downwind at the harbour exit to Cook Strait which is where you'll go if you can't water re-launch your kite! Also close to shore downwind of the launching spot the wind can get really gusty and can be difficult to keep your kite in the air. Try to get upwind to cleaner wind. In a S or SW the place has a different feel and is more suited to the intermediate or novice. Here you can go downwind several hundred meters. Once past the jetty though the water close to shore is sheltered and will probably require a swim to get back to the beach.

	![Wellington Seatoun](/assets/images/maps/map_wellington_seatoun.png)

:   S, SW: Petone  
	[Details](https://sites.google.com/site/wellingtonkitesurf/home/petone)  
	Setting up and Launch  
	The launch site can be found at Hikoikoi Reserve. To get there follow the Esplanade east along the sea front until the road turns away from the beach just past the Mobil garage. Take the next right (Kircaldy St), next left (Marin Parade) and next right which takes you along a short road to the beach. There's plenty of beach here for launching. Also sports fields are directly behind the beach and act as safety net is things go wrong. Just watch out for the gorse and bushes between the beach and the fields. (The sports fields also make a great area for practicing kite flying skills)  
	On the Water  
	The wind again will be onshore to some degree. For the novice the best time to launch is between mid and low tide where you can walk out tosea for about 40 meters. There is a good 300m stretch of beach that does not run alongside the main road. Please stick to this are if you're a novice. In a straight southerly Petone seems to have the most consistant wind in Wellington.The shallow sloping beach also causes small waves to break on the windier days giving good port tackramps. Please do not sail anywhere infront of the main road to the west of the launch area, the busy road runs right behind the small beach and there is no safe area for landing kites

:   SE, S: Lyall  
	[Details](https://sites.google.com/site/wellingtonkitesurf/home/lyall-bay)  
	Contact the airport control tower and ask permission prior to launch (04) 387 1980  
	Setting up for the Launch  
	The only place to set-up, launch and land in Lyall bay is at the far westend/corner of the beach, in front of the toilet block, where thewindsurfers also rig and launch from. This the most upwind point in the bay. Launching anywhere east of the lifesaving club buildings is not advisable as it is almost impossible to sail upwind through the shorebreak here. Please do not attempt to launch down at the east end of the beach by the airport.The beach is long and sandy but can be very narrow at high tide, so launching is recommended at low tide. A main road runs adjacent to the beach and not only does it have the usual power lines but also has high voltage bus power cables too. Launching in the corner can be gusty.  
	On the Water  
	Sailing is restricted to the west side of the bay, the "Briscoes" building marks the end of the fly zone, even better turn back at the "Accountants" building. Lyall Bay offers some of Wellingtons best conditions with good wind and waves for the advanced rider. The normal Southerly wind is cross-onshore from the right meaning starboard tack to get out through the surf. Lyall throws up some great rideable waves which can be ridden upwind (port tack) or down-the-line on starboard.
