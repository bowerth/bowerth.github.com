Dear Sir or Madame,

Herewith I am applying to a position as Associate Developer in the Guardian's Development Team.

After attending the Spark Europe Summit 2015 in Amsterdam, I have been exploring Scala and the Play framework. I would like to learn more about the change management involved in this process and dig deeper into the frontend source code shared at https://github.com/guardian/frontend.

Having worked more than five years at the Paris-based OECD, I do realise the effort you have made in adopting the digital-first principle. Despite my background in economics and Chinese studies, I have a strong interest in programming. Together with experts from my team we were looking at Global Value Chains and I developed a cloud computation tool to meet daily needs of our external collaborators, see http://www.icio.oecd.org. Using this tool we can identify the differences between the direct and indirect trade relationship of the UK with the EU.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,
Bo Werth
