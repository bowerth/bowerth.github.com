Dear Sir or Madame,

Please find my CV online at http://bowerth.github.io/cv for the post advertised at indeed.com on 12 October.

The nature of my work and degree course has prepared me for this position. It involved a great deal of graphical storytelling on macroeconomic indicators requiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. I am creating data visualizations with R and the htmlwidgets package. You can find examples of my work at http://bowerth.github.io/datascience/2015/09/13/R-htmlwidgets. I have managed to set up the first cloud computing instance and interactive visualization instance of OECD at http://www.icio.oecd.org. I have longstanding experience of photo editing software from my time at highschool when I was doing amateur video editing using Adobe Premiere. I have made extensive use of mapping tools by Garmin and experimented with editing maps using various tools, the latest among them is designed for the creation of web applications, http://geotrellis.io.

I am a fast and accurate programmer, with a keen eye for detail and I should be very grateful for the opportunity to progress to data journalism. I am able to take on the responsibility of this position from January 2016, and have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely
Bo Werth
