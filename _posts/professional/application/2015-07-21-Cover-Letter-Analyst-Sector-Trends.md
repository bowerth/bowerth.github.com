<!-- ### How I feel my skills and experience match what you are looking for -->

<!-- #### Work experience -->

In my job as statistician, I am working with experts of economics and political science on a daily basis. Our stakeholders are governments of member countries and we cater for a mix of ministries, press and academic sector. Combining understanding of economic models and information technology, I am able to identify and implement possible approaches to transform complex results into key messages. I am staying up-to-date with latest developments in the area of data science and my work environment allows to implement recent technology. My academic background is economics (innovation, international trade, corporate finance) and Chinese Studies (command of written and spoken language, studies on sociology, geography and history).

<!-- #### Open Source Tools -->

<!-- ##### R -->

My first exposure to statistical computing was using SQL and SAS in 2010. The lack of objects other than tables motivated me to explore the use of R and soon I discovered its strength for graphics and reporting. I am heavily relying on the packaging capacity of R. With the advent of RStudio Shiny in 2013, I am very grateful to Joe Cheng for creating a tool that helps removing barriers between analysts and statisticians.

<!-- ##### JavaScript -->

Creating browser interfaces with RStudio Shiny, JavaScript visualizations become and interesting option. I have used the htmlwidgets package to create flexible D3 visualizations from R, e.g. chord diagrams or treemaps.

<!-- ##### Latex and markdown -->

At university, I discovered the strength of Latex. With the knitr package and pandoc writer, it became a useful tool for reproducible analysis. I am creating shell scripts in Linux or use the "make" command to combine steps of data analysis and report generation, e.g. see Peter Baker's dryworkflow https://github.com/petebaker/dryworkflow.

<!-- ##### Git -->

I am using Git version control to work with external collaborators, e.g. a SDMX Java library with the Bank of Italy. It also comes handy to configure cloud servers.

<!-- ### What motivated me to apply for the role -->
The job description gave the impression you are working with modern open source tools. I am convinced this is the way forward for analytical projects understaken by the public sector. I would like to join a team of like-minded people with solid statistical and computer science skills. The range of data you are handling sounds adapted for visual display and the creation of online tools.
