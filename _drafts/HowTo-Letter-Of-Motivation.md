## How to write a motivation letter

Ideally, a cover letter has no more than four paragraphs. The goal of the first is to specify what you are applying for and how did you find out about that opportunity. The last one outlines your availability for an interview, suggesting in this way a concrete follow-up for your application.

The second paragraph should list your skills and qualifications that make you the right person for the position you are applying for. Read carefully the announcement, identify the requirements and see how your skills match those required. Do not simply state you have them, prove it. Ideally, you should start from your experience and show how you have developed those qualifications by doing what you have been doing/learning. Same as in the case of your CV, the result should portrait you as an independent, creative person that can take initiative and deal with responsibilities, apart from the specific skills needed for the job. In short, the second paragraph should show why you are good for the job.

The third should point out why you want it. You should outline your interest for the skills you are going to learn if you get the job. The impression left should be that you can make a genuine contribution to the company's operations, while simultaneously deriving satisfaction from your work.

It is customary for formal letters to mention whether you have enclosed any documents accompanying the letter. Simply mention enclosure, or write curriculum vitae under the heading enclosure at the end of the letter.

If you are emailing it request a notification that your documents have been received. Wait at least two weeks since the day you sent your application or after the deadline before writing again in the case you did not get any answer.


## How to write a good motivation letter

This letter will be read in most cases after your CV. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the details which has already been added in the CV but worth mentioning which has not already been added in the CV: your goals, your ambitions, your strengths and expectations and clear also, of course, what interests you in the post and / or the company.

The motivation letter will reflect your understanding of the position, your tactics, your language, so your level of culture and, more broadly, your intelligence and your personality.

"Convinced that my profile matches your expectations, I would be very happy to meet you to let you know more about my ambitions and my motivations, and consider all the possible collaboration."
