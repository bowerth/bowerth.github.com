### Leave entry in PATS

Annual leave / home leave / uncertified sick leave
:   Timekeepers in the Directorate

Exceptional leave
:   the Staffing Administration team of HRM (hrm.admin@oecd.org) not HRM/BAMS  
    In order to facilitate the distribution of the medical certificates for exceptional leave please remind staff in your Directorate/Service that their name should be clearly indicated on the doctor’s certificate (not always the same as family member referred to);  their file number (available on My OECD Kiosk);  the exact date(s) / hours of exceptional leave being requested (not always clear on certificate).  
    It is preferable to send a scanned copy of the certificate via e-mail as the original is not required.

Certified sick leave
:   HRM/BAMS, the original of the “arrêt de travail” is mandatory within 48 hours of the beginning of the period.
